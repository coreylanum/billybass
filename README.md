# 🐟 Billy Big Mouth Bass - AI Interactive Robot

Transform your Billy Big Mouth Bass into an AI-powered interactive robot that responds to questions with fish puns!

## 📋 What You Need

### Hardware
- ✅ Billy Big Mouth Bass shell (with 3 DC motors: body, mouth, tail)
- ✅ Raspberry Pi (3/4/5 recommended)
- ✅ 4WD Robot Hat for Raspberry Pi (CKK0018)
- ✅ USB External Audio Interface (microphone + speaker)
- ✅ Momentary push button (if not using original)
- ✅ Power supply: 7.4V LiPo battery or 6-12V DC adapter
- ✅ MicroSD card with Raspberry Pi OS (32GB+ recommended)

### Software Requirements
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm or newer)

### API Keys (Required)
- **Anthropic API Key** - For Claude AI responses ([Get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/))
- **OpenAI API Key** - For Whisper speech-to-text ([Get one here](https://platform.openai.com/))

## 🔧 Hardware Setup

### Step 1: Mount the Robot Hat
1. Stack the 4WD Robot Hat onto your Raspberry Pi's 40-pin GPIO header
2. Ensure it's firmly seated and all pins are aligned

### Step 2: Connect Motors
Connect the three Billy Bass motors to the Robot Hat terminal blocks:

```
M1 (Motor 1) → Body Motor (turns fish)
M2 (Motor 2) → Mouth Motor (open/close)
M3 (Motor 3) → Tail Motor (wagging)
```

**Note:** If a motor runs backwards, swap its +/- wires.

### Step 3: Connect the Button
- **Button wire 1** → GPIO 5 (Physical Pin 29)
- **Button wire 2** → Ground (Physical Pin 30)

**Important:** GPIO 17 is used by the body motor driver - use GPIO 5 for the button!

### Step 4: Connect USB Audio
1. Plug USB audio interface into any USB port on the Pi
2. Connect microphone to the interface's mic input
3. Connect speaker output to Billy Bass's speaker (or use USB audio's built-in speaker)

### Step 5: Power
1. Connect power supply (6-12V) to the Robot Hat's power terminal
2. The Hat will power the Raspberry Pi through GPIO - **do not** use USB power simultaneously

## 💻 Software Installation

### 1. Set Up Raspberry Pi

```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install required system packages
sudo apt install -y git libasound2-dev sox libsox-fmt-all alsa-utils gpiod mpg123 ffmpeg
```

### 2. Install Node.js

```bash
# Install Node.js 20.x
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs

# Verify installation
node --version  # Should show v20.x.x
npm --version   # Should show 10.x.x
```

### 3. Configure USB Audio

```bash
# List audio devices
arecord -l   # Find your USB mic card number
aplay -l     # Find your USB speaker card number

# The code is configured for hw:3,0
# If your device is different, update billy-bass.js:
#   device: 'hw:3,0'  // Change to your card number

# Test microphone with your device
arecord -D hw:3,0 -d 3 test.wav
aplay test.wav
```

### 4. Clone and Install Project

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir ~/billy-bass
cd ~/billy-bass

# Copy project files (billy-bass.js, package.json, etc.)
# Then install dependencies
npm install

# Install additional system dependencies for audio
sudo npm install -g node-gyp
```

### 5. Set Up API Keys

```bash
# Add to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile
nano ~/.bashrc

# Add these lines at the end:
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key-here"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key-here"

# Save and reload
source ~/.bashrc
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Motors Individually

Create `test-motors.js`:

```javascript
const i2c = require('i2c-bus');

const bus = i2c.openSync(1);
const address = 0x14;

// Initialize
bus.writeByteSync(address, 0x00, 0x00);

function testMotor(motorNum, duration = 2000) {
  console.log(`Testing Motor ${motorNum + 1}...`);
  
  // Turn on motor (adjust register addresses for your hat)
  const baseReg = 0x20 + (motorNum * 4);
  bus.writeWordSync(address, baseReg, 2000); // Mid speed
  bus.writeByteSync(address, baseReg + 2, 1); // Forward
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    bus.writeWordSync(address, baseReg, 0); // Stop
    console.log('Stopped');
  }, duration);
}

// Test each motor with 3 second delays
testMotor(0); // Body
setTimeout(() => testMotor(1), 4000); // Mouth
setTimeout(() => testMotor(2), 8000); // Tail
setTimeout(() => bus.closeSync(), 12000);
```

Run: `node test-motors.js`

### Test Audio Recording

```bash
# Record 3 seconds
arecord -d 3 -f cd test.wav

# Play back
aplay test.wav
```

### Test Button

```bash
# Monitor GPIO 17
gpio -g mode 17 in
gpio -g read 17  # Should change when button pressed
```

## 🚀 Running Billy Bass

```bash
cd ~/billy-bass
npm start
```

You should see:
```

## 🎛️ Customization

### Adjust Motor Speeds

Edit the `CONFIG` section in `billy-bass.js`:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  // Motor Speeds (0-100)
  BODY_TURN_SPEED: 60,      // Body rotation speed
  BODY_TURN_DURATION: 1500, // How long to turn (ms) - ADJUST to match your fish!
  MOUTH_SPEED: 70,          // Mouth movement speed
  TAIL_SPEED: 50,           // Tail wagging speed
  
  // Audio
  AUDIO_RECORDING_DURATION: 5000, // Recording time (ms)
  
  // Text-to-Speech Voice
  TTS_VOICE: 'onyx', // Options: alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, shimmer
  TTS_MODEL: 'tts-1', // or 'tts-1-hd' for higher quality
  
  // AI
  AI_MODEL: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
  AI_SYSTEM_PROMPT: `You are Billy Bass, a wise-cracking animatronic fish...`
};
```

**Important:** Adjust `BODY_TURN_DURATION` to match your fish's turning range. The motor turns for this duration, then uses electrical braking to hold position against the return spring. This prevents both grinding (from continuous running) and spring-back (from stopping). If the motor still reaches its physical limit, reduce the duration. Start with 1500ms and adjust as needed.

### How Motor Braking Works

The Billy Bass has a spring that returns the body to its original position. To hold the fish facing forward during the conversation:
- **Turn:** Motor runs forward to turn fish toward user
- **Hold:** Motor enters "brake mode" (both pins HIGH) - creates electrical resistance to hold against spring
- **Return:** Motor coasts (both pins LOW), spring pulls fish back, motor briefly assists

This mimics the original Billy Bass behavior!

### Change TTS Voice

OpenAI offers 6 different voices:
- **alloy** - Neutral and balanced
- **echo** - Warm and upbeat
- **fable** - British accent, expressive
- **onyx** - Deep and authoritative (default for Billy)
- **nova** - Energetic and youthful
- **shimmer** - Soft and gentle

Just change `TTS_VOICE: 'onyx'` to any of the above!

### Change AI Personality

Modify the `AI_SYSTEM_PROMPT` to change Billy's personality:

```javascript
AI_SYSTEM_PROMPT: `You are Billy Bass, a sophisticated fish philosopher.
Respond with profound wisdom and occasional fish puns. Keep responses to 1-2 sentences.`
```

### Auto-Start on Boot

```bash
# Create systemd service
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/billy-bass.service
```

Add:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Billy Bass AI Robot
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=pi
WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/billy-bass
Environment="ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key"
Environment="OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key"
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /home/pi/billy-bass/billy-bass.js
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable billy-bass.service
sudo systemctl start billy-bass.service
sudo systemctl status billy-bass.service
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Motors Not Working
- Check GPIO connections (see wiring diagram)
- Verify power supply voltage (6-12V) to Robot Hat
- Test individual motors with `gpioset` commands
- Check motor wire polarity (swap if backwards)
- Ensure NSLEEP pins (GPIO 12 & 13) are HIGH

### No Audio Recording
- Run `arecord -l` to find USB audio device
- Check `.asoundrc` configuration
- Test with: `arecord -d 3 test.wav && aplay test.wav`
- Ensure USB audio has enough power (use powered hub if needed)

### Button Not Responding
- Check GPIO wiring (GPIO 17, Pin 11)
- Test with: `gpio -g read 17`
- Verify button is normally open (closes when pressed)

### API Errors
- Verify API keys are set: `echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- Check API key permissions and credits
- Test internet connection
